# Novel Match Website

So Basically, we're gonna be building a website where you can find a book/novel similar
to one you previously liked. Basically, we will let people create an account and suggest
a book. Under the comment section of that book, others will comment what other books they
have read that's most similar to that book. Also we will have some sort of algorithm which
will read the comments and have a counters that kinda shows the top novels on big screen.

Work in Progress!
